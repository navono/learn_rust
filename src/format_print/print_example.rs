// Printing is handled by a series of macros defined in `std::fmt`
// format!: write formatted text to String
// print!: same as format! but the text is printed to the console (io::stdout).
// println!: same as print! but a newline is appended.
// eprint!: same as format! but the text is printed to the standard error (io::stderr).
// eprintln!: same as eprint!but a newline is appended.

// fmt::Debug: Uses the {:?} marker. Format text for debugging purposes.
// fmt::Display: Uses the {} marker. Format text in a more elegant, user friendly fashion.

// Implementing the fmt::Display trait automatically implements the ToString trait which allows us
// to convert the type to String.

pub fn print_example() {
    // In general, the `{}` will be automatically replaced with any
    // arguments. These will be stringified.
    println!("{} days", 31);

    // Without a suffix, 31 becomes an i32. You can change what type 31 is
    // by providing a suffix. The number 31i64 for example has the type i64.

    // There are various optional patterns this works with. Positional
    // arguments can be used.
    println!("{0}, this is {1}. {1}, this is {0}", "Alice", "Bob");

    // As can named arguments.

    );

    // Special formatting can be specified after a `:`.
    println!(
        "{} of {:b} people know binary, the other half doesn't",
        1, 2
    );

    // You can right-align text with a specified width. This will output
    // "     1". 5 white spaces and a "1".
    println!("{number:>width$}", number = 1, width = 6);

    // You can pad numbers with extra zeroes. This will output "000001".
    println!("{number:0>width$}", number = 1, width = 6);

    // Rust even checks to make sure the correct number of arguments are
    // used.
    println!("My name is {0}, {1} {0}", "Bond", "Lee");
    // FIXME ^ Add the missing argument: "James"

    // Create a structure named `Structure` which contains an `i32`.
    #[allow(dead_code)]
    struct Structure(i32);

    // However, custom types such as this structure require more complicated
    // handling. This will not work.
    // println!("This struct `{}` won't print...", Structure(3));
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line.
